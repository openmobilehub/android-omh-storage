# Getting Started with Android OMH Storage

Android OMH Storage is a project that integrates various cloud storage providers into Android applications. It offers a unified API to work with different storage providers.

## Prerequisites

Before integrating any storage provider into your Android project, ensure you meet the following requirements:

- **Gradle version**: 7.0 or higher
- **Android API level**: 23(GoogleDrive, Dropbox), 26(OneDrive) or higher

Additionally, ensure you have the following packages installed before proceeding with the integration:

- [`com.openmobilehub.android.storage:core:2.0.0`](https://miniature-adventure-4gle9ye.pages.github.io/docs/core)
- [`com.openmobilehub.android.auth:core:2.0.2`](https://github.com/openmobilehub/android-omh-auth)

## Installation

To integrate a storage provider into your Android project, follow the steps below to install one of the available Maven Central packages:

| Storage provider       | Package                                                              | Min Android API level |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Google Drive (GMS)     | `com.openmobilehub.android.storage:plugin-googledrive-gms:2.0.0`     | 23                    |
| Google Drive (non-GMS) | `com.openmobilehub.android.storage:plugin-googledrive-non-gms:2.0.0` | 23                    |
| OneDrive               | `com.openmobilehub.android.storage:plugin-dropbox:2.0.0`             | 26                    |
| Dropbox                | `com.openmobilehub.android.storage:plugin-dropbox:2.0.0`             | 23                    |

### 1. Configure Maven Central repository

Add the following code snippet to your root **build.gradle** file to ensure Maven Central is included as a repository:

```gradle
allprojects {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
}
```

### 2. Add dependency for the desired storage provider

Add the appropriate dependency for the desired storage provider to your project's **build.gradle** file. Replace `<storage-provider-name>` with the specific storage provider package name and `<version>` with the latest version available as shown in the table above:

```gradle
dependencies {
  implementation("com.openmobilehub.android.storage:plugin-<storage-provider-name>:<version>")
}
```

## Storage provider configuration

Each storage provider requires specific secrets for configuration. Please follow the individual storage provider configuration guides:

- [Google Drive](https://miniature-adventure-4gle9ye.pages.github.io/docs/plugin-googledrive-gms/#configuration)
- [OneDrive](https://miniature-adventure-4gle9ye.pages.github.io/docs/plugin-onedrive/#configuration)
- [Dropbox](https://miniature-adventure-4gle9ye.pages.github.io/docs/plugin-dropbox/#configuration)

## Usage

In this guide, we'll use the Google Drive storage provider as an example. You can choose any other storage provider since the exposed methods are identical across all storage storage providers. Each storage provider implements the [`OmhStorageClient`](https://miniature-adventure-4gle9ye.pages.github.io/api/packages/core/com.openmobilehub.android.storage.core/-omh-storage-client) interface, ensuring consistent functionality. This uniformity means you won't need to learn new methods regardless of the storage provider you choose!

### ðŸ’¡ GOOD TO KNOW

> Any operation you can perform on files can also be applied to folders.

### Initializing

Before interacting with any storage provider, you must first initialize both the OMH Auth Client and OMH Storage Client with the necessary configurations specific to that storage provider.

```kotlin
val omhAuthClient = OmhAuthProvider.Builder()
    .addNonGmsPath("com.openmobilehub.android.auth.plugin.google.nongms.presentation.OmhAuthFactoryImpl")
    .addGmsPath("com.openmobilehub.android.auth.plugin.google.gms.OmhAuthFactoryImpl")
    .build()
    .provideAuthClient(
        context = context,
        scopes = listOf(
            "openid",
            "email",
            "profile",
            "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive",
            "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file"
        ),
        clientId = "<YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID>"
    )

val omhStorageClient = OmhStorageProvider.Builder()
    .addGmsPath(GoogleDriveGmsConstants.IMPLEMENTATION_PATH)
    .addNonGmsPath(GoogleDriveNonGmsConstants.IMPLEMENTATION_PATH)
    .build()
    .provideStorageClient(omhAuthClient, context)
```

### Get root folder path

Retrieves the root folder path of the storage service. Useful when you want to list files in the root folder.

```kotlin
val rootPath = omhStorageClient.rootFolder
```

### List files

Lists files from a specific folder.

```kotlin
val files = omhStorageClient.listFiles(parentId = "folderId")
```

### Search files
