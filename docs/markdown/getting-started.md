# Getting Started with Android OMH Storage

Android OMH Storage is a project that integrates various cloud storage providers into Android applications. It offers a unified API to work with different storage providers.

## Prerequisites

Before integrating any storage provider into your Android project, ensure you meet the following requirements:

- **Gradle version**: 7.0 or higher
- **Android API level**: 23(GoogleDrive, Dropbox), 26(OneDrive) or higher

## Installation

To integrate a storage provider into your Android project, follow the specific steps for each provider:

- [Google Drive](https://openmobilehub.github.io/android-omh-storage/docs/plugin-googledrive-gms)
- [OneDrive](https://openmobilehub.github.io/android-omh-storage/docs/plugin-onedrive)
- [Dropbox](https://openmobilehub.github.io/android-omh-storage/docs/plugin-dropbox)

## Usage

### ðŸ’¡ GOOD TO KNOW

> Any operation you can perform on files can also be applied to folders.

### Get root folder path

Retrieves the root folder path of the storage service. Useful when you want to list files in the root folder.

```kotlin
val rootPath = omhStorageClient.rootFolder
```

### List files

```kotlin
val files = omhStorageClient.listFiles(parentId = "folderId")
```

### Search files

Lists files with names containing the specified query value.

```kotlin
val searchResults = omhStorageClient.search(query = "fileName")
```

### Create folder

Creates a folder in a specific folder.

```kotlin
val newFile = omhStorageClient.createFolder(
    name = "fileName",
    parentId = "folderId"
)
```

### Create file (with mime type)

Creates a file in a specific folder.

```kotlin
val newFile = omhStorageClient.createFileWithMimeType(
    name = "fileName",
    mimeType = "fileMimeType",
    parentId = "folderId"
)
```

### Create file (with extension)

Creates a file in a specific folder.

```kotlin
val newFile = omhStorageClient.createFileWithExtension(
    name = "fileName",
    extension = "ext",
    parentId = "folderId"
)
```

### Update file

Updates a remote file with the content of a local file.

```kotlin
val updatedFile = omhStorageClient.updateFile(
    localFileToUpload = File("localFilePath"),
    fileId = "fileId"
)
```

### Delete file

Moves a file with the given file ID in the trash.

```kotlin
omhStorageClient.deleteFile(id = "fileId")
```

### Permanently delete file

```kotlin
omhStorageClient.permanentlyDeleteFile(id = "fileId")
```

### Upload file

Uploads a local file to a specific folder.

```kotlin
val uploadedFile = omhStorageClient.uploadFile(
    localFileToUpload = File("localFilePath"),
    parentId = "folderId"
)
```

### Download file

Downloads a file with the given file ID.

```kotlin
val fileContent = omhStorageClient.downloadFile(fileId = "fileId")
```

### Export file

Exports a provider application file with the given file ID to a specified MIME type.

```kotlin
val exportedFileContent = omhStorageClient.exportFile(
    fileId = "fileId",
    exportedMimeType = "desiredMimeType"
)
```

### Get file metadata

Retrieves the metadata of a file with the given file ID.

```kotlin
val fileMetadata = omhStorageClient.getFileMetadata(fileId = "fileId")
```

> For more details on file metadata support for each provider, please refer to the [File metadata documentation](https://openmobilehub.github.io/android-omh-storage/docs/#file-metadata).

### Get file versions

Retrieves the versions of a file with the given file ID.

```kotlin
val fileVersions = omhStorageClient.getFileVersions(fileId = "fileId")
```

### Download file version

Downloads a specific version of a file.

```kotlin
val versionContent = omhStorageClient.downloadFileVersion(
    fileId = "fileId",
    versionId = "versionId"
)
```

### Get file permissions

Lists the permissions of a file with the given file ID.

```kotlin
val permissions = omhStorageClient.getFilePermissions(fileId = "fileId")
```

### Create file permission

Creates a permission for a file.

```kotlin
val userPermission = OmhCreatePermission.CreateIdentityPermission(
    OmhPermissionRole.WRITER,
    OmhPermissionRecipient.User("test@email.com")
)

val newPermission = omhStorageClient.createPermission(
    fileId = "fileId",
    permission = userPermission,
    sendNotificationEmail = true,
    emailMessage = "Optional message"
)
```

> For more details on file permissions support for each provider, please refer to the [File permissions documentation](https://openmobilehub.github.io/android-omh-storage/docs/#file-permissions).

### Update file permission

Updates the role of a permission in a file.

```kotlin
val updatedPermission = omhStorageClient.updatePermission(
    fileId = "fileId",
    permissionId = "permissionId",
    role = OmhPermissionRole.ROLE
)
```

### Delete file permission
